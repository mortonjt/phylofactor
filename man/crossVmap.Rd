\title{maps groups from old to new communities for phylofactor cross-validation}
\usage{
crossVmap(Grps, tree, original_community, new_community,
  ignore.interruptions = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{Grps}{list of length two containing the names of taxa (found in tip-labels of \code{tree}) in two groups separated by an edge or chain of edges.}

\item{tree}{phylo class object. Must contain all \code{Grps}, \code{original_community} and \code{new_community}}

\item{original_community}{original community being factored (strings corresponding to tip-labels of \code{tree}. This helps us ID the new branches in the \code{new_community}}

\item{new_community}{new community being cross-validated (strings corresponding to tip-labels of \code{tree})}
}

c1 <- c('t1','t2','t5','t6','t3','t4')
c2 <- setdiff(tree$tip.label,c('t3','t4','t5'))

grp1 <- c('t1','t2')
grp2 <- c('t5','t6')
Grps <- list(grp1,grp2)

factored.edges <- getFactoredEdges(grp1=match(grp1,tree$tip.label),grp2=match(grp2,tree$tip.label),tree=tree)

ecols <- rep('black',Nedge(tree))

# one clade interrupts our chain of branches: t7
# another clade: [t3,t4], was factored out previously and is not in our Grps

# We want an optional output "ignore.interruptions=T' which omits interruptions
# in output of group comparisons. 
# if ignore.interruptions=F, we want to output the list of possible groups for iteration and refinement of which edge along the chain holds an effect.

# the default is to ignore interruptions, and it should output
# [[t1,t2]],[[t6]]
# by succesfully ignoring t7.

crossVmap(Grps,tree,c1,c2)

#correct

#Quick check - let's include two interruptions, one of which contains the root
grp1 <- c('t3','t4')
grp2 <- c('t5')
Grps <- list(grp1,grp2)
c1 <- c(grp1,grp2,'t6')
c2 <- setdiff(tree$tip.label,'t4')

#correct output should be [[t3]],[[t5]]
crossVmap(Grps,tree,c1,c2)


# Now, suppose we wanted to use those interruptions to refine phylofactorization
# to a subset of the original edges

crossVmap(Grps,tree,c1,c2,ignore.interruptions = F)

#notice the output: the first and last entries are our output from crossVmap
#when ignore.interruptions=T. The intervening elements are the interrupting clades
#in the order in which they interrupt the factored edges.
