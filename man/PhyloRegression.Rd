\usage{
PhyloRegression(LogData, X, frmla, Grps = NULL, choice, treeList = NULL, cl,
  totalvar = NULL, ix_cl, treetips = NULL, grpsizes = NULL,
  tree_map = NULL, quiet = T, nms = NULL, smallglm = F, choice.fcn, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{LogData}{Logarithm of Compositional data matrix whose rows are parts and columns are samples.}

\item{X}{independent variables for input into glm.}

\item{frmla}{Formula for input into glm by lapply(Y,FUN = pglm,x=xx,frmla=frmla,choice,...).}

\item{Grps}{Groups - a list whose elements are two-element lists containing the groups and their compliments for amalgamation into ILR coordinates}

\item{choice}{Choice function for determining the group maximizing the objective function. Currently the only allowable inputs are 'var' - minimize residual varaince - and 'F' - minimize test-statistic from anova.}

\item{treeList}{List of trees formed by phylofactorization and cutting trees along factored edges.}

\item{cl}{phyloFcluster input for built-in parallelization of grouping, amalgamation, regression, and objective-function calculation.}

\item{totalvar}{Total variance of dataset.}

\item{ix_cl}{Cluster split of nodes in treeList}

\item{treetips}{Number of tips in treeList for quickly identifying whether nodes correspond to a root}

\item{grpsizes}{Number of nodes in each tree of treeList}

\item{tree_map}{Cumulative number of nodes in trees of treeList - allows rapid mapping of nodes in ix_cl to appropriate tree in treeList.}

\item{quiet}{Logical to supress warnings}

\item{nms}{rownames of LogData, allowing reliable mapping of rows of data to tree.}

\item{smallglm}{Logical. See \code{\link{PhyloFactor}}}

\item{choice.fcn}{optional customized choice function to choose 'best' edge; see \code{\link{PhyloFactor}}}
